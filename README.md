# Pry website on GitHub Pages
Pry website is hosted using GitHub Pages, which in turn are served
by [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) on GitHub. On push,
the site is re-generated by GitHub and published on:
<http://pry.github.com>

## Local development
There’s a few dependencies to install when developing the site on
your own computer.

### [Bundler](http://gembundler.com/)
All development dependencies are contained within the Gemfile. To
use it, you’ll need to install bundler.

    gem install bundler

Once bundler is installed, you can install the dependencies:

    bundle install

### [Foreman](http://ddollar.github.com/foreman/)
There’s a Procfile in the site directory, which describes how to
start Jekyll and Compass to Foreman. All you need to do, once you
have installed dependencies with Bundler, is to start Foreman:

    foreman start

That should be it! Now you can change files wildly and you’ll see
them by pointing your browser to `http://localhost:5000`.

#### [Compass](http://compass-style.org/)
Compass is used to ease the pain of CSS. Compass will find all
files in the `_scss/` directory ending with `.scss`, and compile
them into the `stylesheets` directory.

#### [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/)
GitHub Pages are powered by Jekyll, and so are we! Configuration
is in `_config.yml` as normal, but it probably doesn’t need to
be touched.
